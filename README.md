# 7-8
Esoteric programming language inspired by the 7-8 meme
Presumably, the meme appeared from VK due to posts like "the last digit of your like will show you in the picture", and someone took and pulled 7-8 out of context and it turned out to be an incomprehensible, but funny joke
Well, at least that's what a friend told me...

## How to use?
The language is based on brainfuck, in the 7-8.js file in the comments it is indicated what it does
